    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p class="hl2"> 
            CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is the primary 
            language used to describe look and formatting for webpages across the Internet and documents of markup (e.g. HTML and XML) in general. If you want to work with designing your own webpages, you need to be able to understand and write CSS. Lucky for you, you've come to the right place, because in this tutorial, you will be able to learn pretty much anything there is to know about CSS, from the most basic stuff about syntax and simple properties,
             to more advanced examples.

            If you're brand new in the world of CSS, I suggest that you start from the top of the Table of Contents to the right and then simply go all the way through the tutorial. It has been organized to start with some very basic theory and then move on to more and more advanced stuff. If you already know some CSS, then I suggest that you snoop around in the various chapters, to learn the stuff you haven't already been exposed to. Each chapter has been written 
            so that you can use it alone, to learn that particular subject.
